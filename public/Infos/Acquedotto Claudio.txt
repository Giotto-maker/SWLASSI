Whilst it was the Emperor Claudius, after whom it is named, who completed the Claudio Aqueduct in 52 AD, it was his predecessor, the Emperor Caligula who began its construction in 38AD.
Today, parts of the Claudio Aqueduct are fairly well preserved and can be seen within the Appia Antica Regional Park.
