Parco della Musica is a large public music complex in Rome, Italy, with three concert halls and an outdoor theater in a park setting, hence the name. It was designed by Italian architect Renzo Piano[1]. Jürgen Reinhold of Müller-BBM was in charge of acoustics for the halls; Franco Zagari was landscape architect for the outdoor spaces
