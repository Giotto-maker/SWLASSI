While the sculpture may be appreciated from multiple angles, 
Bernini planned for it to be viewed from the right because 
the work would have been visible from the doorway where it was located.
Viewing the sculpture from this angle allowed the observer to see the reactions of 
Apollo and Daphne simultaneously, thus understanding the narrative of the story in a single instant, 
without the need to move position
