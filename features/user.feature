    As an administrator
    So that I can protect the system from malicious users 
    I want to block an user

    And a logged in user
    And another user with base privileges

Scenario: Admin cannot block an Admin user

    Then I should be on the users page
    And I should see "luca.andolfi03@gmail.com"
    When I follow "Block luca.andolfi03@gmail.com"
    Then I should see "You cannot block this user"

Scenario: Admin can block an base user
